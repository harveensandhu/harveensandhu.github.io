### Web Components Critique

 Looking at web components again, I can see the benefit that it provides in terms of segmenting code, hiding code and the constructure of documents.
 For the future I think it will benefit the development world in allowing developers to create their own elements, templates and be able to manipulate their code for the user.
 One aspect that I still find hard to grasp is the use of shadow DOM, as I can't see the overall use that it can have and its impact on web developement. However, after some more reading I can see that it has a benefit in segementing code so that large amounts of code changes do not need occur.
 
 What I feel is missing is more information, lessons and a broader understanding of its application. For us college students, this is a fundamental stage and progression in web developement studies and it would make it more beenficial for more awareness and classes on this subject.
 Although at this moment I am finding it difficult to grasp all elements of Web Components, with more info and tutorials it will make it much more easier to understand.
 
 In the future I can see issues with using too many web components that make it overwhelming for an app to be developed Looking at the Custom Elements page, it could suggest pitfalls in terms of constructing javascript files to read at specific page loads etc.
 However I do not know much about Web Components, to make an accurate guess, but I see struggles in too many web components being used at one time, naming conventions and styles.
