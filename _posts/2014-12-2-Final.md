#####Responsive Images

When it comes to responsive imagery there have been many ways that we have tried to get images to respond to the size of the viewport such as media queries. Though that can be time consuming and a lot of code.

Here are two ways that can work to make images responsive within a viewport that doesn’t require too much coding.

#####Picturefill vs. Focal Point

#####Picturefill

Like we have seen in our class you can use Picturefill - the picture element to hold sources of images that at different viewports it will change, such as this:

```
<picture>
	
        <source media="(min-width:1024px)" srcset="desktop/cake.jpg, desktop/cake@2x.jpg 2x">
        
        <source media="(min-width:768px)" srcset="tablet/cake.jpg, tablet/cake@2x.jpg 2x">
        
        <img srcset="mobile/cake.jpg, mobile/cake@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Cake" class="static">
        
</picture>
```
At 1024px, 768px and in mobile (320px) the images will switch out and if on a high definition it will pull the image that is larger (HD)

However there are some cons to using Picturefill in its basic form:
	-Resizing many images
	-Making @2x images
	-Time consuming

You could also use Picturefill in a more advanced setting by setting the size attribute:


```
<picture>
    <img 
     srcset="large/cake.jpg 1024w,
             medium/cake.jpg 640w,
             small/cake.jpg 320w"
     sizes="(min-width: 20em) 66.6vw, (min-width: 48em) 50vw, (min-width: 64em) 100vw,
            100vw"
     alt="Cake" />
 </picture>
```
Here, you are setting images for the different widths such as, 1024w, 640w, 320w, 
then with the size attribute you set a min-width size in em and a length.
So basically in english, you are saying to the browser, “Hey, when you are at a min-width of 20em, then find an image to set at 66.6vw of the viewport.” When you do this, the browser picks the image that best fits.

Some examples:

You can then play around with different sizes and try to pull the image that you want:
```
<picture>
    <img 
     srcset="large/rings.jpg 1024w,
             medium/rings.jpg 640w,
             small/rings.jpg 320w"
     sizes="(min-width: 20em) 66.6vw, (min-width: 48em) 20vw, (min-width: 64em) 90vw,
            100vw"
     alt="Cake" />
 </picture>
```

However, it can get tricky, as you may put a size that doesn’t allow the image you want to choose, to be pulled into the viewport:
```
 <picture>
    <img 
     srcset="large/me.jpg 1024w,
             medium/me.jpg 640w,
             small/me.jpg 320w"
     sizes="(min-width: 20em) 33.3vw, (min-width: 48em) 60vw, (min-width: 64em) 99vw,
            100vw"
     alt="Cake" />
 </picture>
```

So now we move onto focal point

This is a new technique which I found and implemented to test its effectiveness

Focal point revolves around cropping th image to the section that you want viewed when on smaller screen sizes. With as much code as this:

```
<div class="focal-point right-5  up-7">
    <div><img src="images/couple2.jpg" alt="couple" ></div>
  </div>
```
Using the files already provided by focal point you can use the given css and rules to crop your images with little code. Here I am saying when at a smaller viewport size from the center of the image, move right 5 sections of the grid and up 7. I purposely used large images so you can truly see it working.

More examples:
```
<div class="focal-point right-5  down-3">
    <div><img src="images/couple1.jpg" alt="couple" ></div>
  </div>
```

```
<div class="focal-point right-6  down-3">
    <div><img src="images/couple3.jpg" alt="couple" ></div>
  </div>
```

Now you know a little more about responsive image techniques… What do you think?
