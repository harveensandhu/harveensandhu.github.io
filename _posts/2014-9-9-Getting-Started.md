##Why I'm Here

I am at Columbia studying Interactive Media, so that one day I can get a job in media and website developement.
I decided to major in Interactive Media at Columbia as it was a better opportunity for me, rather than staying in England and pursuing a career that I did not enjoy.

I'm interested in web developement as I really like how any ideas that you have you can manipulate them on screen and be able to share it with a vast range of people and different types of audiences. At the moment I am fairly comfortable and enjoy working with HTML, CSS, however now I am learning javascript which is challenging for me, but the results make web development even more interesting.

###Current Inspiration

- [Designmodo](http://designmodo.com/) I like designmodo as it gives you up to date posts on the latest designs, softwares and technologies that are being used
- [Pop](https://popapp.in/sketchpad/) I have used Pop before to test an app I was designing for a class and really enjoyed its ease of use and its great to go back and use it you want to test out any prototypes.
- [Charles Ifergan](http://www.charlesifergan.com/) I chose this site as it is one that I worked on at my past internship for a client in Chicago, Charles Ifergan. This site acts as inspiration in terms of thinking of the real world and to work hard to get there, asthe process I went through when helping construct this site was one that was new to me.
