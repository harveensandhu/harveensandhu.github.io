Review

Interacting with the site was interesting in terms of the use of media, such as a combination of audio, photography and video used to tell the story.
Scrolling through the site and engaging with the multiple media made it feel as if I were apart of the story, hearing the sounds and seeing the surroundings.
Although as I was navigating the site, one particular element stood out and actually became somewhat distracting to the whole composition. The use of snippets of texts on certain images that needed endless scrolling to then proceed to the next step became tiresome.
I feel it could be improved if there was more text on the image so that the amount of scrolling is equal to the amount of text, or that the scrolling time between images is kept at the same duration.

I then viewed the site on safari (after chrome), and on this browser, it started to seem choppy, load times for the video were jumpy and delayed and the overall experience was distracting.
Viewing the site on a mobile device was a different experience, as the scrolling effect was not as strong, the text that is over the images was placed below, and also the media elements such as video and audio were not working.

Overall I enjoyed the experience, as I found it refreshing to see a news story captured in an interactive way, however there are certain aspects that I feel could be improved to further increasae engagement and make it less "choppy".
