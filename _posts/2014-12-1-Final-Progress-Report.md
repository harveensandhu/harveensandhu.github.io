### Final Progress Report

So for my final project, I have started my comparison between Picturefill responsive images versus Focal Point. I have completed my first section of picturefill and started my focal point code samples.
Though what is giving me trouble is the Picturefill size attribute, trying to make the pictures scale in proportion to what I had stated in my code.
Another factor is that whether it is pulling the right image.

To finish my project I need to complete the picturefill size attribute demonstration, once I have the sizing correct, then all I need to do is re-check all my other demos such as piccturefill - basic, and focal point.
After my code demostration pages have been fully built I need to compile everything together in a post, which will include
  -Code Samples
  -Demonstration Links to pages
  -Overall Summary of each section.
  
The only things left of the project is to make sure everything is working, I do not have  any concerns or troubles at the moment.
I do not have any code samples to show at the moment, as it is all still a work in progress - and which I had already emailed my concerns.

I am enjoying this final as I am able to experiement with new technologies.
