###Old Browsers

In my personal opinion I think it is beneficial that old browsers become left behind due to the advances in technology and the capabilities of such browsers as Chrome and Mozilla.
If people are still using old browsers such as IE9, the capabilities, cross browser testing and making content for the web makes it harder and more complex to cater to everyone. If everyone migrated to the new browsers it would make their own experience of viewing certain web content much more effective.

Some people still choose to use outdated browsers for particular reasons such as, some need the services of IE9 to fufill tasks, some find old browsers a personal preference and have become accustomed to its style and functionality. Lastly, to upgrade to newer browsers and versions can have a negative impact on people in terms of cost.

I would say that as developers we should not forget about the people using old browsers, but we shouldn't always have to worry that our content or page wont work or render the way we want it to for a minority of people. For example, adding snippets of code to mkae sure a video or image shows up in IE9 is acceptable, but having to change your whole site to accomodate a small number is not worth it in my opinion. Technology is increasing at an amazing rate, and if we as developers have to stop ourselves from creating what we want or have to spend double time to cater to old browser users, it dosen't seem as any benefit to any developer.

Eventually in the future I see the older browser uses being left behind, only to find that they would have to shift to the newer browsers to be able to keep with the demand and the content that is out there.
