### Web Components

After watching the video on Web Components, I became overwhelemed with how much content and information was given to me, in terms of subjects, the process and structure.
I am at this moment feeling intimidated at the whole process and what each section entails. Learning about templates, Shadow DOM, Custom Elements and HTML Imports was interesting, as I learnt new vocabularly and how a web developer would go about creating new elements and being able to pull/pull out these elements within the code.
The easiest topic that I can kind of understand to a certain extent is Custom Elements. I like the concept of being able to create your own HTML elements, as this will make it easier in terms of relating your elements to its content, but also will make coding more efficient in terms of using prototypes to hold code that is then extended. I think custom elements will make it easier to group code snippets and like elements together.

What is challenging and confusing is the use of host and shadow DOM, as I could not understand the differentiation between hidding the shadow DOM elements, and not being able to type that within the code of the custom element.
However, I did like the portion of the video, where he talks about being able to style individual elements and by using specific function you can enable and disable these styles that are applied.

I find this a challenging concept to grasp, yet like all languages, after practice, it will be easy enough to implement.

I believe web components provide great potential for the future of the web, allowing developers to become collaborative memebrs in creating the language that they use daily to better influence their projects.
I do think it has a long way to go in terms of understanding its use, how it is applied and also browes support - which I think is one of its pitfalls.

Although, now to think of it, wouldn't a pitfall be, that there are no set guidleines or boundaries to what you can call your components? Yes, we will use the hyphen between naming conventions, but would this cause future problems?
