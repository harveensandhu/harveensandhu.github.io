### Web Apps vs. Native Apps

After reading about native apps vs. web apps, I initally was in favor of native apps, having many downloaded onto my phone and using htem daily, I cealrly thought that it was better for natvie apps to be produced rather than web apps.

However, understanding the varied differences and the strengths and weaknesses between the two I have come to see that it is more benficial to many people to use and develop web apps for particular reasons. For example, it seems better for web apps to be produced due to the developing lanugauge, such as HTML, CSS and javascript which can be used across all devices and platforms, compared to native apps haveing to altered and reproduced for different devices.

Web Apps offer more in terms of accessibility, performance, budget and developing skills compared to native apps. Although native apps aesthetic appeal is of a higher quality, it is safe to say that as our technology increases the aesthetic of web apps will become of or of a higher standard of current native apps.

If I were to tell someone to create an app and what technology is worth learning, I would have to go with web app - HTML, CSS and javascript, and with the increase in web component technology, it would be more beneficial for developers to learn these skills set to better develop web apps for consumers, making it easier for consumers of all platforms access the same content.
